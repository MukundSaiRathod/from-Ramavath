>I love Hyderabadi biryani for its rich blend of spices and the unique “Dum” cooking technique that infuses deep, complex flavors into every bite. The way it layers marinated meat and basmati rice makes each mouthful aromatic and satisfying. Whether I choose chicken, lamb, or vegetables, it always caters to my taste perfectly. Plus, its cultural heritage adds a special touch to every meal.
